Havoc: A relational programming language whose compiler is usually correct.

If this language looks interesting, you should first check out Pure at
http://pure-lang.googlecode.com. It is similar to Havoc in that it supports
term rewriting, but has the following benefits over Havoc:

1. It probably has no potentially debilitating contradictions
2. It has reasonable performance
3. Its compiler is not necessarily NP-complete
4. Its compiler exists
