Introduction.
Havoc generally uses an operator-precedence parser, but there are a few cases where it assigns more structure to your programs. For example, f x = y ∀ x and f x == y ∀ x mean two completely
different things; which version of equality you use changes the nature of the ∀ quantifier. So = and ∀ are linked for many purposes, and you can think of the two as forming a ternary =∀
expression.

Similarly, the ⋅ qualification operator changes the precedence of = to its right. For example:

| f x = x + y ⋅ y = 10 ∀ x    ->    ((f x) = ((x + y) ⋅ (y = 10))) ∀ x

Mechanics of operator precedence.
I mentioned above that Havoc uses an operator precedence parser, but this isn't true in the usual sense. Havoc implements only a very simple Lisp-style parser. The remaining structure comes
from rewrite rules that approximate the behavior of an operator precedence parser. The important thing to realize about this is that you can write your own equations that change how this is
done. For example, here are some builtins:

| x + y * z = x + (y * z) ∀ x y z
  x * y + z = (x * y) + z ∀ x y z
  ...

Now let's suppose you want to make some exception to these rules. For example, let's introduce an operator called $$ whose left-side precedence is high and whose right-side precedence is low:

| a * b $$ c + d = a * b (c + d) ∀ a b c d
  ...

This isn't the best way to do it. Better is to use abstraction over operators with similar roles. For example, let's define some properties of common arithmetic operators.

| associative (+)
  associative (*)
  left-associative (-)
  left-associative (/)
  precedence (-) = precedence (+)
  precedence (*) = precedence (/)
  precedence (+) < precedence (*)

Now we can write inference rules for those properties:

| associative op = ((x op y) op z = x op (y op z) ∀ x y z) ∀ op
  left-associative op = (x op y op z = (x op y) op z ∀ x y z) ∀ op
  precedence op1 < precedence op2 = (x op1 y op2 z = x op1 (y op2 z) ∀ x y z) ∀ op1 op2

These inference rules govern the rewrite process that causes operators to fold into precedence-sensitive structures.
