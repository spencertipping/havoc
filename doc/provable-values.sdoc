Introduction.
Havoc uses empirical constructivism as a logical foundation, unlike Prolog which has similar inference semantics but uses the law of the excluded middle. In fact, Havoc has no built-in
negation operator; you have to define its semantics manually if you want to use one. What this all means for a programmer is that unless your program constructs a value, Havoc will not assume
its existence. Once a value is constructed it is considered to be 'proven' and will trigger equation rewriting.

Role of provable values in metaprogramming.
Values specified at the toplevel are considered to be axioms of your program, and as such each one is provable. The set of provable values is theoretically the transitive closure of axioms
across axiomatic equivalence relations, but in practice it is not this large. (This allows your program to have an infinite transitive closure but compile in finite time.)

Conjunctions.
It's fairly obvious how you can tell Havoc 'y is true iff x is true', but what about conjoined truth? To do this, you use the 'and' operator:

| associative op and noncommutative op = ... âˆ€ op

This tells Havoc that the right-hand side of the equation is true for all operators for which 'associative op' and 'noncommutative op' can both be proven. Similarly, you can use 'and' to draw
multiple conclusions from a single equation:

| group op = associative op and has-zero op and invertible op
