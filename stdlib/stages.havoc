Execution stages.
This allows Havoc to behave sort of like Lisp. Each stage is basically a flag that prevents execution from happening at the wrong time.

'compile (a op$ b) = ('compile a op$ 'compile b),

'compile ('right-associative (op$) = ('compile (a op$ b op$ c) = 'compile (a op$ (b op$ c))))
